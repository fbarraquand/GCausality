### List of things to do when re-working on the article

* Include - in Appendix or additional figure - (stochastic) Lyapunov exponents computed for the models

* Something to document additionnally: the construction of surrogates for CCM (and perhaps to get better p-values for GC?)







### Stuff that might be better in another, follow-up article

* New p-values based on good surrogates, including for GC-type models

* A detailed investigation of confounding with different data structures (currently we only have X<-U->Y):
  1. U->X->Y
  2. X->Y<-U
  3. U->X-|Y

This could be combined with a non-dynamic causal evaluation Ã  la Pearl. 
Note: our many-species case actually include confounding to some degree, we can use it to evaluate the causal inference on some of these causal structures

We can do blind analyses to search for confounding effects.
