# File description

This folder contains the data, scripts, results and figures for the 20 species model. Some of the files (scripts, figures or results) are in explo folders, corresponding to previous analyses which are not used in the final paper. Some of the results are used in scripts which can be found in the 10 species folder. 

In the `script` folder,  

* `20Species_dataGeneration_randomWithinBounds.R` produces the simulated dynamics of the 20 species model that are then stored in the `data` folder

* `analysis_CCM_surrogates.R` computes the probability associated to the interactions between each species using the CCM method in the 20 species model.
