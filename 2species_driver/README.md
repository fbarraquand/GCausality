# File description

This folder contains the data, scripts, results and figures for the model with 2 species and abiotic driver model (with and without interactions between species). Some of the files (scripts, figures or results) are in explo folders, corresponding to previous analyses which are not used in the final paper.

* `2competitors_and_climate_plot_CCM.R` shows the graphical results for CCM analyses.
* `2competitors_and_climate_factorized.R` computes the results for both Granger-causality and CCM analyses.
* `results_twospecies.R` compares the results from both GC and CCM. 
* `shared_driver_coeff_estimates` contains estimates of driver effects, both for the 2 species and abiotic driver model considered in the main text as well as additional scenarios (lower growth rates, white noise driver).
