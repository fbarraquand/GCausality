# GCausality

Companion code to *Inferring species interactions using Granger causality and convergent cross mapping* by F. Barraquand, C. Picoche, M. Detto and F. Hartig. Linear Granger causality and convergent cross-mapping are implemented using standard ``R`` packages. Here, we stick to time-domain approaches from packages ``vars`` and ``lmtest`` for Granger causality, and call ``rEDM`` for convergent cross-mapping. 

The analyses are organised in folders corresponding to our case studies. Please see the [arXiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00731) for a description of the case studies, as well as the READMEs within each folder for more information on their structure and content.
